								<h3>A Universal Theme</h3>
								<p>"How do we treat those who look 'other'?"</p>
								<p>Unique Approach - Unlike medical-focused disability docs, UNMASKED frames Michel's job hunt as an existential quest for dignity</p>
					    <hr>
              <h2>Treatment & Story Approach</h2>
								<p>The documentary will follow a thematic approach rather than a strictly chronological narrative.</p>
								<p>There will be no voiceover narration; the story will unfold through:</p>
								<h3>Michel's day-to-day experiences</h3>
								<p>focusing on his search for employment and interactions with society.</p>
								<h3>Intimate conversations with Michel's brother</h3>
								<p>revealing personal and familial perspectives</p>
								<h3>Medical and scientific insights</h3>
								<p>including interviews with experts from VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology.</p>
								<h3>Philosophical and sociological perspectives</h3>
								<p>including discussions with philosophers.</p>
								<h3>Reflections from public figures</h3>
								<p>who spoke about living with facial differences.</p>
								<h3>Historical reference to Joseph Merrick's</h3>
								<p>abandonment in Brussels connections between past and present.</p>
								<p>The approach will be immersive and observational, allowing the audience to experience Michel's world without artificial dramatization.</p>
								<p>The goal is to create an emotional yet intellectually engaging film that challenges perceptions.</p>
					    <hr>
              <h2>Director's Statement</h2>
								<p>UNMASKED is a personal exploration of perception and identity. Rather than framing Michel as an object of sympathy,
								the film emphasizes his agency, resilience, and humanity. By immersing audiences in Michel's world, the film challenges
								how we judge others based on appearance.<br>
								<br>
								I am deeply committed to telling this story with sensitivity, authenticity, and respect. 
								My goal is to create a film that not only resonates with audiences but also inspires them to see the world—and each other—with greater empathy and understanding.</p>
				  	<hr>
            <h2>Visual Style and Approach</h2>
								<p>The visual style of "Unmasked" will be intimate and cinematic</p>
								<h3>Cinematic</h3>
								<p>naturalistic cinematography emphasizing intimacy</p>
								<h3>Observational</h3>
								<p>storytelling avoiding artificial dramatization</p>
								<h3>Interviews</h3>
								<p>shot in dynamic, engaging settings</p>
								<h3>Minimalist</h3>
								<p>immersive sound design</p>
								<br>
								<p>The film will have a poetic, emotional tone, using music and sound design to enhance the storytelling.</p>
					  <hr>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>"Unmasked" is an intimate exploration of identity, self-acceptance, and resilience. Through Michel's personal journey, the film aims to challenge conventional ideas of beauty, success, and human worth.<br><br>
								The documentary is both a personal narrative and a social commentary on how appearance affects the way we are treated, and ultimately, the way we see ourselves.<br><br>
								By sharing Michel's story, we hope to ignite a broader conversation about the need for a more inclusive and compassionate world—one where worth is defined by who we are on the inside, not just how we look on the outside.</p>
